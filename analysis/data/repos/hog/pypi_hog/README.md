### Install

```pip3 install --upgrade scribehog```

### Usage

```hog [options] logcategory [interval]```

__Options:__  
`-h`, `--help`  Print usage information.  
`-v`, `--verbose`  Verbose logging.  
`-y`, `--verify`  Require user confirmation before printing the selected logs.  

`logcategory`  a hyphen-separated list of words or word prefixes to test against the hyphen- or underscore-separated logcategory names.  
For example: if your logcategory is called `alpha_bravo_charlie`, you can match it with `alpha-bravo-charlie`, or just `al-brav-c`, maybe even `a-b-c`, as long as it's unambigious given the list of all logcategories.  
Note that the order of the words does not matter, ie. `al-br-ch` and `ch-br-al` are the same.  

`interval`  a reference to the file or files you want to read. The default value is `-1`, meaning the most recent file. You can either use negative numbers as relative references like this, or specify a date and time in the format of `hh`, `dd-hh`, `mm-dd-hh`, or `yyyy-mm-dd-hh`. For example, you can pass `-3` for the third most recent logfile, or `10-09` for the logfile on the 10th at 9:00 AM (note the leading 0 in the hour).  

Ranges can also be specified by using a colon, eg. `-3:-2` or `10-15:10-18`.  
Relative and absolute references can be freely mixed, eg. `-10:12-31-20`.  
When omitting a reference from either side of the colon, the end of the list is assumed, just like in Python list slicing, eg. `-5:`.  

You don't have to know if the specified files are gzip-compressed or not, hog takes care of that for you.  
The contents are uniformly printed to stdout, so you can pipe the output into `grep`, `less` or whatever you need to use.  

### Development

Make sure you have Python (>=3.5) installed.  
Clone the repository, then call `make develop`.
